"""This repository is PUBLIC. Nothing in it may name a real estate.

Ported from WebhookWise on 2026-08-24, after a manual sweep found a real
production alert rule name (its threshold included), a real Grafana folder and a
real platform hostname across nine test fixtures here — and the same names all
through this repository's history. Fixture realism is how estate names spread:
they look like test data, so nothing scans them.

Placeholders must be obviously fictional. `示例…` and `demo-…` are; a real
project name is not, and neither is a team handle somebody can @-mention.

    python3 scripts/assert_no_estate_identifiers.py

THE PATTERN LIST IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY. Carrying the patterns inline would
make this file the last public copy of exactly the words the scrub removed —
together with the replacement for each, which is a decoding table. The mechanism
is public; the list is not.

The list lives in `.estate-identifiers` (git-ignored, format in
`.estate-identifiers.example`), and in CI in a repository secret written to that
path before this runs. Set ESTATE_GUARD_REQUIRED=1 there: without it a missing
list would make this exit 0 and the protection would evaporate silently, which
is the failure mode the guard exists to prevent.

Add a pattern the moment a real name gets scrubbed, or the scrub decays into a
one-off cleanup that the next paste undoes.
